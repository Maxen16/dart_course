//Day two mainly dealt with rest of datatypes ,some types of variables and some constraints to dealt when assigning variables.

///They are,
4.Assigning variables, datatype not mentioned instead "var" is used.
5.Assigning to const values, cont values can be assigned to final but not vice versa.
6.Inferring datatypes, eg: in const no need to specify datatype, they infer datatype automatically, "const myAge = 20" and "const int myAge = 20" both are valid.
7.Mutating of const content.
8.Final allow mutating of varialbe content.
9.Assign const & final.
10.Late variable.
11.Data types.
12.Type promotion, less precise value to high precise value, ie int to double, vice versa is called Type demoting, ie double to int.
13.Specifying datatypes, apply analysis_option.yaml  "always_specify_types"  to help indicate to annote datatype , if user forget to mention.
14.Naming conventions,  ie camelcase  eg:myAge,yourName ,(we can ignore: non_constant_identifier_names), and lowercamelcase for constant naming(we can ignore: constant_identifier_names).
15.various datatypes, ie int,double,string,bool,list,map,set,dynamic,symbol.

//End of day Two.
